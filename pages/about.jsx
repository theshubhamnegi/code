        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>What you do in free time?</h2>
        <p>
          In my free time, I watch anime, play games, read some books (E-Books), and think about why I got errors in code and how to solve them.
        </p>
        <h2>Why you start programming?</h2>
        <p>
          Making something new is the most fascinating thing and for me when I create an Excel file for the computer lab it amuses me. and later by landing some fingers on the keyboard I jumped on programming.  
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you want to be a Data Scientist?</h2>
        <p>
          Every time I work with data, I discover something that surprises me. In spite of that, Uncollected data, though, surprises me the most, because it can be something totally different that can turn everything around.
        </p>
